My edits: 
1. Use the "NAME_WRITER_RFID.ino" file for writing name to the RFID Tag Cards.
   You can directly write the in the rfid cards without reuploading the code everytime to esp.

   Step 1: Upload the "NAME_WRITER_RFID.ino" to esp8266.

   Step 2: Press the RESET button on nodeMCU.

   Step 3: Open Serial Monitor and type your desired name.

   Step 4: Scan the card and Voila!

   Step 5: Now you need not to re-upload the code just press the RESET button to set a new name.

   Step 6: Follow from Step 2 for Uploading a new name to a RFID Card. (will not happen without pressing RESET)

2. Just follow the above steps for writing to the card otherwise follow the video
